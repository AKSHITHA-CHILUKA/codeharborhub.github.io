React Native is a popular framework for building mobile applications using React and JavaScript. It allows developers to create native mobile apps for iOS and Android using a single codebase.

#### 1. What is React Native?

- **React Native**: A framework developed by Facebook that enables developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Instead of using native languages like Swift or Java/Kotlin, React Native allows you to use React to create components that render as native mobile UI elements.

- **Core Concept**: React Native bridges the gap between web and mobile development by allowing you to write your code in JavaScript, while leveraging native platform capabilities.

#### 2. Benefits of Using React Native
   :::note
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Write once, run everywhere. React Native allows you to use the same codebase for both iOS and Android, reducing development time and effort.
  
- **Fast Development**: With features like hot reloading, you can instantly see changes in your app as you develop, speeding up the development process.

- **Native Performance**: React Native uses native components, which ensures that apps have high performance comparable to native applications.

- **Large Community and Ecosystem**: React Native has a vast community of developers and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools, making it easier to find solutions and support.

- **Code Reusability**: Share code between web and mobile apps, if you use React for web development, you can reuse components and logic in your React Native apps.
