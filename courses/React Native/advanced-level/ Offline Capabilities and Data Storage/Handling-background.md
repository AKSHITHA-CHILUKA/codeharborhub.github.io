**1.1. Background Tasks**

Background tasks enable you to perform operations like syncing data or fetching updates even when the app is not active.

**Using `react-native-background-fetch`:**

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install react-native-background-fetch
```

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
import BackgroundFetch from 'react-native-background-fetch';

BackgroundFetch.configure(
  {
    minimumFetchInterval: 15, // Minutes
    stopOnTerminate: false, // Continue running in background
  },
  async () => {
    console.log('Background fetch event received');
    // Perform background tasks such as syncing data
    BackgroundFetch.finish();
  },
  error => {
    console.log('Background fetch failed', error);
  }
);
```

**1.2. Push Notifications**

Push notifications are used to alert users about important updates even when the app is not in the foreground.

**Using `react-native-push-notification`:**

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install react-native-push-notification
```

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
import PushNotification from 'react-native-push-notification';

PushNotification.configure({
  onNotification: function (notification) {
    console.log('Notification:', notification);
    // Process the notification
  },
  requestPermissions: true,
});

// Create a notification
PushNotification.localNotification({
  title: 'My Notification',
  message: 'This is a test notification',
});
```
 
:::tip
- **Offline Storage:** Use `AsyncStorage` for simple key-value storage and `SQLite` for more complex data needs.
- **Data Syncing:** Implement an offline-first strategy with local storage and sync when connectivity is restored. Use network status monitoring and background tasks for reliable data syncing.
- **Background Tasks and Push Notifications:** Use libraries to handle background tasks and push notifications to keep users informed and manage app updates efficiently.
