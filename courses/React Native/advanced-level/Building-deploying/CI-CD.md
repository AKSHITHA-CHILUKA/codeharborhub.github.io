**1.1. Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines:**

 **Choose a CI/CD Tool:**
   - Popular options include **GitHub Actions**, **CircleCI**, **Travis CI**, and **Bitrise**.

:::note
 **Create CI/CD Configuration:**

   - **GitHub Actions Example:**

     Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file:

     ```yaml
     name: React Native CI

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v2

           - name: Set up Node.js
             uses: actions/setup-node@v2
             with:
               node-version: '14'

           - name: Install dependencies
             run: npm install

           - name: Build Android
             run: cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease

           - name: Build iOS
             run: |
               cd ios
               pod install
               xcodebuild -workspace YourApp.xcworkspace -scheme YourApp -configuration Release -archivePath $PWD/build/YourApp.xcarchive archive
               xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath $PWD/build/YourApp.xcarchive -exportOptionsPlist YourApp/Info.plist -exportPath $PWD/build
     ```
:::

  **Automate Deployment:**

   - Configure deployment steps within your CI/CD tool to automatically deploy to the app stores or distribute builds to testers.



:::tip
- **Building and Configuring:** Follow platform-specific procedures to build apps for iOS and Android.
- **Signing and Publishing:** Use tools provided by Apple and Google to sign and publish your apps.
- **Handling Updates:** Manage versioning and updates through app store consoles.
- **CI/CD:** Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate building, testing, and deployment processes.
