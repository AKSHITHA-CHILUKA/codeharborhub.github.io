#### Topics Covered:
1. Introduction to PHP Frameworks
2. Overview of Popular Frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter)
3. Setting Up and Using a Framework 

### 1. Introduction to PHP Frameworks

**PHP frameworks** are libraries or platforms that provide a structured way to build web applications. They offer reusable components, tools, and best practices for development, which streamline the development process and ensure that code is clean, maintainable, and secure.

:::important
**Benefits of Using PHP Frameworks:**
- **Rapid Development:** Frameworks come with built-in tools and libraries, accelerating the development process.
- **Code Reusability:** Frameworks promote DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, making it easier to reuse code.
- **Security:** Frameworks offer built-in security features like protection against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.
- **Scalability:** Frameworks are designed to handle scalability, making it easier to build applications that can grow with user demand.
- **Community and Support:** Popular frameworks have large communities and extensive documentation, which can help solve development issues quickly.

### 2. Overview of Popular Frameworks

#### Laravel

**Laravel** is a popular PHP framework known for its elegant syntax and powerful features. It offers an extensive set of tools and libraries for modern web development.

:::note
- **Features:**
  - **Eloquent ORM:** An object-relational mapping (ORM) tool for database interactions.
  - **Blade Templating Engine:** A powerful templating engine with convenient features.
  - **Artisan CLI:** A command-line interface for automating tasks.
  - **Laravel Mix:** A tool for asset compilation and optimization.
:::

**Setup Example:**

```bash
# Install Laravel using Composer
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-laravel-app
```

**Basic Route Example:**

```php
// routes/web.php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

#### Symfony

**Symfony** is a flexible PHP framework that follows the best practices and standards for web development. It is known for its robustness and high performance.

:::note
- **Features:**
  - **Twig Templating Engine:** A fast and secure templating engine.
  - **Doctrine ORM:** An advanced ORM for database interactions.
  - **Bundles:** Reusable components and features.
  - **Flexibility:** Allows you to use only the components you need.
:::

**Setup Example:**

```bash
# Install Symfony using Composer
composer create-project symfony/skeleton my-symfony-app
```

**Basic Route Example:**

```php
// src/Controller/DefaultController.php
namespace App\Controller;

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

class DefaultController
{
    /**
     * @Route("/", name="homepage")
     */
    public function index()
    {
        return new Response('Hello World!');
    }
}
```

#### CodeIgniter

**CodeIgniter** is a lightweight PHP framework known for its simplicity and performance. It is easy to install and has a small footprint.

:::note
- **Features:**
  - **MVC Architecture:** Follows the Model-View-Controller pattern.
  - **Built-in Libraries:** Provides a set of libraries for common tasks.
  - **Simple Configuration:** Minimal configuration is needed to get started.
:::

**Setup Example:**

```bash
# Download CodeIgniter
composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter my-codeigniter-app
```

**Basic Route Example:**

```php
// app/Config/Routes.php
$routes->get('/', 'Home::index');
```

### 3. Setting Up and Using a Framework

**Laravel Setup:**

1. **Install Composer** if not already installed.
2. **Create a New Laravel Project:**

    ```bash
    composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-laravel-app
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory and Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    cd my-laravel-app
    php artisan serve
    ```

**Symfony Setup:**

1. **Install Composer** if not already installed.
2. **Create a New Symfony Project:**

    ```bash
    composer create-project symfony/skeleton my-symfony-app
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory and Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    cd my-symfony-app
    symfony server:start
    ```

**CodeIgniter Setup:**

1. **Install Composer** if not already installed.
2. **Create a New CodeIgniter Project:**

    ```bash
    composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter my-codeigniter-app
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory and Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    cd my-codeigniter-app
    php spark serve
    ```
