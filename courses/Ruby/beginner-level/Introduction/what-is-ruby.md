### History and Evolution of Ruby

**Ruby** was created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in the mid-1990s. The first public release was in 1995. Ruby was designed to be more powerful than Perl and more object-oriented than Python. Over the years, Ruby has grown in popularity, especially with the advent of the Ruby on Rails framework in 2004, which greatly boosted its adoption for web development.
