Ruby on Rails, often just called Rails, is a web application framework written in Ruby. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern and emphasizes the use of convention over configuration (CoC) and the don't repeat yourself (DRY) principle.

#### **1. Introduction to Ruby on Rails**

**Ruby on Rails** is designed to make web application development faster and easier by providing a comprehensive set of tools and libraries. It encourages the use of best practices and common patterns.

**Features of Ruby on Rails**:
- **Convention over Configuration**: Rails has sensible defaults that allow developers to focus on writing code instead of configuring settings.
- **DRY Principle**: Rails encourages reusable code to avoid redundancy.
- **Built-in Testing Framework**: Rails includes tools for testing, making it easier to write and maintain testable code.

#### **2. Setting up a Rails Project**

To set up a Rails project, you need to have Ruby and Rails installed on your system. You can install Rails using the following command:

```bash
gem install rails
```

**Creating a New Rails Project**:
```bash
rails new myapp
cd myapp
```

This command generates a new Rails application with a default directory structure and configuration.
