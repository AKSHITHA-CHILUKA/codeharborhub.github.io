MongoDB provides support for multi-document transactions, which allow multiple operations to be executed as a single, atomic unit. This ensures that either all the operations in the transaction are applied, or none of them are, providing consistency and reliability.

#### Introduction to Multi-Document Transactions

A transaction in MongoDB allows a set of read and write operations on multiple documents (and potentially multiple collections) to be executed in an all-or-nothing manner. This means that all operations within a transaction are either committed or rolled back together.

#### Best Practices for Transactions

- **Keep Transactions Short**: Transactions that take a long time to complete can block other operations and reduce performance. Aim to keep transactions as short as possible.
- **Limit the Number of Operations**: Each operation within a transaction adds overhead. Minimize the number of operations within a transaction to improve performance.
- **Use Transactions Only When Necessary**: Transactions provide strong guarantees but also add overhead. Use them only when necessary to maintain consistency and atomicity.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Ensure that your application can handle transaction failures and retries appropriately. Use proper error handling to manage transaction commit or abort scenarios.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Transactions can introduce complexity. Thoroughly test transaction logic to ensure correctness and handle edge cases.
