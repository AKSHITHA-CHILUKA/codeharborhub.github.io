**Log Analysis**: Analyzing MongoDB logs helps identify performance issues, errors, and potential bottlenecks.

**Key Log Files**:
- **MongoDB Logs**: Contain information about operations, errors, warnings, and performance.
  - **Path**: `/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log` (default path)

**Important Log Entries**:
- **Slow Queries**: Identifying queries that take longer than a specified threshold.
  - Configure slow query logging in `mongod.conf`:
    ```yaml
    operationProfiling:
      slowOpThresholdMs: 100
      mode: slowOp
    ```
- **Errors and Warnings**: Look for error messages and warnings that indicate issues.
- **Replication Logs**: Monitor replication status and identify issues in replica sets.

**Performance Metrics**: Track various performance metrics to ensure optimal operation.
- **CPU and Memory Usage**: Monitor system resource utilization.
- **Disk I/O**: Track read/write operations and latency.
- **Network Traffic**: Monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **Query Performance**: Analyze query execution times and optimize slow queries.
