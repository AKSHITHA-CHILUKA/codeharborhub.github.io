   - Click on the "Connect" button to establish a connection to your MongoDB instance.

3. **Exploring Databases and Collections**:
   - Once connected, MongoDB Compass displays a list of databases in your MongoDB instance.
   - Click on a database to view its collections.
   - Click on a collection to view its documents.

4. **Performing CRUD Operations**:
   - **Create**: Use the "Insert Document" button to add a new document to a collection.
   - **Read**: Use the query bar to filter documents based on specific criteria.
   - **Update**: Select a document and use the "Edit" button to modify its fields.
   - **Delete**: Select a document and use the "Delete" button to remove it from the collection.

5. **Schema Analysis**:
   - MongoDB Compass provides a "Schema" tab that allows you to analyze the structure of your data, including field types, usage, and distributions.
