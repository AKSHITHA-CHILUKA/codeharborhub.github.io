#### Understanding Data Modeling

Data modeling is the process of defining a structure for your database. In MongoDB, this involves deciding how data should be stored, organized, and accessed. Effective data modeling ensures that your database can handle your application's needs efficiently and can scale as required.

:::note
**Key Considerations in Data Modeling**:
- Understand the data and how it will be used.
- Consider the types of queries and updates that will be performed.
- Optimize for the common use cases.
- Balance between read and write operations.
- Plan for data growth and scaling.
