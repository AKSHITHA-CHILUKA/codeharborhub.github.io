| Feature       | SQL                                                      | NoSQL                                                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Model**| Relational model with tables, rows, and columns. Fixed schema. | Flexible data models (document, key-value, column-family, graph). Schema-less or dynamic schema. |
| **Schema**    | Requires predefined schema.                              | Dynamic schema, allowing for more flexible and scalable data structures. |
| **Scalability**| Typically scales vertically by increasing the power of a single server. | Typically scales horizontally by adding more servers.              |
| **Transactions**| ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance. | Generally BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) compliance, but some NoSQL databases offer ACID transactions as well. |
| **Use Cases** | Suitable for structured data and complex queries (e.g., banking systems, enterprise applications). | Suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data, real-time web applications, big data, and scalable applications (e.g., social media, content management). |
