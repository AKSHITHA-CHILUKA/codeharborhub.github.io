#### History of C++
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey. It was designed as an extension of the C programming language with the addition of object-oriented features. The first commercial release of C++ was in 1985, and since then, it has undergone numerous updates and improvements, making it a powerful and versatile programming language.
