#### What is Next.js?

**Next.js** is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for React applications. Developed by Vercel, it aims to provide a seamless developer experience while enhancing performance, scalability, and SEO. Next.js builds on top of React and provides a number of additional features to improve the development process and application performance.

#### Benefits

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js enables server-side rendering, which allows pages to be pre-rendered on the server and sent to the client as fully rendered HTML. This improves initial load times and SEO.

2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Next.js can generate static HTML at build time for pages that don't need to be rendered on every request. This results in fast load times and efficient performance.

3. **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits code into smaller bundles that are loaded only when needed, optimizing page load times and performance.

4. **API Routes**: Next.js allows you to create API endpoints within the same application, simplifying the process of building full-stack applications.

5. **Optimized Performance**: With features like automatic static optimization, image optimization, and lazy loading, Next.js applications are highly performant.

6. **Built-in CSS and Sass Support**: Next.js has built-in support for importing CSS and Sass files, making it easy to style your applications.

7. **Developer Experience**: Features like fast refresh, which provides instantaneous feedback on edits without losing component state, make the development process more efficient and enjoyable.
