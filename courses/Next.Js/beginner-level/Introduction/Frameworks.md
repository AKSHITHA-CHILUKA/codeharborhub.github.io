1. **Next.js vs. React**:
   - **React**: A library for building user interfaces. It focuses on the view layer and requires additional libraries and tools for routing, state management, and server-side rendering.
   - **Next.js**: A framework built on top of React that provides out-of-the-box features like SSR, SSG, and file-based routing. It simplifies the setup and development process for React applications.

2. **Next.js vs. Angular**:
   - **Angular**: A full-fledged framework developed by Google that includes a complete set of tools for building single-page applications. It uses TypeScript by default and has a more opinionated structure.
   - **Next.js**: Focuses on server-side rendering and static site generation for React applications. It is less opinionated than Angular and provides more flexibility in terms of tools and libraries.

3. **Next.js vs. Vue/Nuxt.js**:
   - **Vue**: A progressive framework for building user interfaces, similar to React in terms of component-based architecture.
   - **Nuxt.js**: A framework built on top of Vue that provides similar features to Next.js, including SSR and SSG.
   - **Next.js**: The React counterpart to Nuxt.js, providing SSR, SSG, and additional optimizations for React applications.
