1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a New Next.js Application**:
   - Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Next.js project:
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
     # or
     yarn create next-app my-next-app
     ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Change to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd my-next-app
     ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Run the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     # or
     yarn dev
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your Next.js application running.
