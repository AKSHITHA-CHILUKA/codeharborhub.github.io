####  Avoiding Race Conditions and Deadlocks

- **Race Conditions**: Occur when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable results. Use synchronization techniques to prevent race conditions.
  
- **Deadlocks**: Occur when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources. Avoid deadlocks by using a consistent order for locking resources.

**Tips**:
- Always acquire locks in a consistent order.
- Use timeout mechanisms to avoid waiting indefinitely.
- Apply the principle of minimal locking.

### Summary

- **Multithreading**: Allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process.
- **Thread Management**: Involves creating, managing, and synchronizing threads.
- **Synchronization**: Essential to avoid data corruption and manage concurrent access.
- **Thread Communication**: Use shared memory and condition variables for inter-thread communication.
- **Concurrency Issues**: Be aware of race conditions and deadlocks and apply best practices to avoid them.
