## 1. What is Cycle Sort?

Cycle Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that is particularly efficient when memory writes are a costly operation. The algorithm minimizes the number of memory writes to sort the array. The idea is to write each element to its correct position and hence reduce the number of write operations.

## 2. Algorithm for Cycle Sort

*Cycle Start:* Begin from the first element of the array.
*Find Position:* For the current element, find the position where it should be placed by counting the number of elements smaller than it.
*Place the Element:* Place the element in its correct position. If the element is already in its correct position, continue to the next element.
*Cycle:* If the element is not in its correct position, put the displaced element to its correct position, creating a cycle of swaps until all elements are in their correct positions.
*Repeat:* Repeat the process for all elements of the array.

## 3. How does Cycle Sort work?

Cycle Sort works by ensuring that each element is placed directly into its correct position.
This is achieved by counting the number of elements smaller than the current element and placing it at the corresponding index.
If an element is already in its correct position, it is skipped.
The displaced element is then placed in its correct position, creating a cycle until all elements are sorted.

## 4. Problem Description
Given an array of integers, implement the Cycle Sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.
