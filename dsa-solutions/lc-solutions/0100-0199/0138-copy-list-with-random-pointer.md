## Problem Description

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 1000].
- `-10000 <= Node.val <= 10000`
- Node.random is null or is pointing to a node in the linked list.

## Approach to Solve the Copy List with Random Pointer Problem

To create a deep copy of a linked list with an additional random pointer, follow these steps:

### Approach

1. **Create Clones Adjacent to Original Nodes:**
   - Iterate through the original list and create a new node for each original node. Insert this new node right next to the original node. This way, each original node will have its clone right next to it.

2. **Assign Random Pointers to Cloned Nodes:**
   - Iterate through the list again. For each original node, if it has a random pointer, set the random pointer of the clone node to point to the clone of the node that the original nodeâ€™s random pointer is pointing to. This can be achieved because the clone of any node `A` is next to `A`.

3. **Restore the Original List and Extract the Cloned List:**
   - Iterate through the list once more to restore the original list by separating the original nodes from their clones. Extract the cloned list by linking the cloned nodes together.

#### Code in Different Languages

### C++
```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node* random;

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        next = NULL;
        random = NULL;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        if (!head) return nullptr;

        // Step 1: Create a new node for each original node and insert it next to the original node.
        Node* curr = head;
        while (curr) {
            Node* newNode = new Node(curr->val);
            newNode->next = curr->next;
            curr->next = newNode;
            curr = newNode->next;
        }

        // Step 2: Assign random pointers for the new nodes.
        curr = head;
        while (curr) {
            if (curr->random) {
                curr->next->random = curr->random->next;
            }
            curr = curr->next->next;
        }

        // Step 3: Restore the original list and extract the copied list.
        curr = head;
        Node* copiedHead = head->next;
        Node* copiedCurr = copiedHead;
        while (curr) {
            curr->next = curr->next->next;
            if (copiedCurr->next) {
                copiedCurr->next = copiedCurr->next->next;
            }
            curr = curr->next;
            copiedCurr = copiedCurr->next;
        }

        return copiedHead;
    }
};
```

### Java
```java
class Node {
    int val;
    Node next;
    Node random;

    public Node(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
        this.random = null;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;

        // Step 1: Create a new node for each original node and insert it next to the original node.
        Node curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            Node newNode = new Node(curr.val);
            newNode.next = curr.next;
            curr.next = newNode;
            curr = newNode.next;
        }

        // Step 2: Assign random pointers for the new nodes.
        curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.random != null) {
                curr.next.random = curr.random.next;
            }
            curr = curr.next.next;
        }

        // Step 3: Restore the original list and extract the copied list.
        curr = head;
        Node copiedHead = head.next;
        Node copiedCurr = copiedHead;
        while (curr != null) {
            curr.next = curr.next.next;
            if (copiedCurr.next != null) {
                copiedCurr.next = copiedCurr.next.next;
            }
            curr = curr.next;
            copiedCurr = copiedCurr.next;
        }

        return copiedHead;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = x
        self.next = next
        self.random = random

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not head:
            return None

        # Step 1: Create a new node for each original node and insert it next to the original node.
        curr = head
        while curr:
            newNode = Node(curr.val)
            newNode.next = curr.next
            curr.next = newNode
            curr = newNode.next

        # Step 2: Assign random pointers for the new nodes.
        curr = head
        while curr:
            if curr.random:
                curr.next.random = curr.random.next
            curr = curr.next.next

        # Step 3: Restore the original list and extract the copied list.
        curr = head
        copiedHead = head.next
        copiedCurr = copiedHead
        while curr:
            curr.next = curr.next.next
            if copiedCurr.next:
                copiedCurr.next = copiedCurr.next.next
            curr = curr.next
            copiedCurr = copiedCurr.next

        return copiedHead
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ - Each of the three steps involves a single pass through the list.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ - The space complexity is constant as we are not using any additional data structures for storage.

### Summary

This approach efficiently creates a deep copy of a linked list with random pointers by leveraging the existing structure of the list and ensuring that each node and its clone are linked adjacently.
