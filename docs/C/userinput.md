---

In C programming, user input refers to data provided by the user during program execution. This input can be read from the standard input device (usually the keyboard) and processed by the program for further computation, output, or storage.

#### Example 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;
    float salary;
    char name[50];
    
    // Prompting user for input
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &number); // Reading integer input
    
    printf("Enter a floating-point number: ");
    scanf("%f", &salary); // Reading float input
    
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    scanf("%s", name); // Reading string input
    
    // Displaying the input received
    printf("You entered:\n");
    printf("Integer: %d\n", number);
    printf("Float: %.2f\n", salary); // Displaying float with 2 decimal places
    printf("Name: %s\n", name);
    
    return 0;
}
```

####  Key Points

1. **`scanf` Function**: 
   - `scanf` is used to read input from the standard input stream (usually the keyboard).
   - It requires format specifiers (`%d`, `%f`, `%s`, etc.) to indicate the type of data being read and where to store it (using memory addresses with `&`).

2. **Format Specifiers**:
   - `%d`: Reads an integer.
   - `%f`: Reads a floating-point number.
   - `%s`: Reads a string (sequence of characters terminated by whitespace).

3. **Reading Input**:
   - Input is read until whitespace (space, tab, newline) is encountered, except for `%c` which reads the next character including whitespace.
   - For strings (`%s`), input is terminated by whitespace or the maximum field width specified.

4. **Handling Input**:
   - Ensure that the variables used with `scanf` are properly defined and match the format specifiers to avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
   - It's crucial to handle input validation and error checking to prevent buffer overflows or incorrect input types.

5. **Buffering and Flushing**:
   - `scanf` leaves newline characters (`\n`) in the input buffer after reading, which can affect subsequent input operations. Using `fgets` for strings or `getchar` to clear the buffer can mitigate this issue.

6. **Security Considerations**:
   - Care must be taken to avoid buffer overflow vulnerabilities, especially when reading strings using `%s`. Using `fgets` or limiting input sizes with maximum field widths (`%Ns`) helps mitigate this risk.

### Conclusion

User input is essential for interactive C programs, allowing them to respond dynamically to user actions. The `scanf` function is a fundamental tool for reading various types of input data, from integers to strings, enabling programs to process and manipulate user-provided information. Understanding how to handle user input in C ensures that programs are responsive and interactive, enhancing their usability and functionality. Proper input validation and error handling are critical for robust and secure applications, ensuring that they behave as expected across different input scenarios. Mastering user input handling in C is essential for developing practical and user-friendly software solutions.
