# Types of Prompts in Prompt Engineering

## Introduction
Different types of prompts can be used to achieve various outcomes when interacting with language models. Understanding these types can help you choose the most appropriate prompt for your specific task.

## 1. Instruction-Based Prompts
Instruction-based prompts provide explicit instructions to the model. They are direct and straightforward, making it clear what the user wants.

**Example:**
- **Prompt:** "Translate the following English sentence to Spanish: 'Good evening.'"
- **Expected Output:** "Buenas noches."

## 2. Example-Based Prompts
Example-based prompts give the model examples of the desired output. This helps the model understand the format and style you are looking for.

**Example:**
- **Prompt:** "Translate the following phrases from English to French: 'Hello' -> 'Bonjour', 'Goodbye' -> 'Au revoir', 'Thank you' ->"
- **Expected Output:** "Merci"

## 3. Contextual Prompts
Contextual prompts provide context to the model, which can help generate more accurate and relevant responses. The context can be a previous conversation, a passage of text, or any relevant information.

**Example:**
- **Prompt:** "Based on the following text, summarize the main idea: 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by automating tasks and providing insights through data analysis.'"
- **Expected Output:** "AI is revolutionizing industries by automating tasks and offering data-driven insights."

## 4. Conversational Prompts
Conversational prompts simulate a dialogue between the user and the model. These are useful for chatbots and virtual assistants.

**Example:**
- **Prompt:** "User: What is the weather like today?\nAssistant: The weather is sunny with a high of 75Â°F. Do you need a weather forecast for a specific location?"
- **Expected Output:** "User: Yes, for New York City."

## 5. Creative Prompts
Creative prompts encourage the model to generate original and imaginative content. These are often used for writing, storytelling, and brainstorming.

**Example:**
- **Prompt:** "Write a short story about a dragon who learns to fly."
- **Expected Output:** "Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a young dragon named Drako. Drako dreamed of soaring through the skies, but he had never learned to fly..."

## 6. Query-Based Prompts
Query-based prompts ask the model to retrieve information or answer questions. These prompts are useful for research, fact-checking, and obtaining specific details.

**Example:**
- **Prompt:** "What are the benefits of regular exercise?"
- **Expected Output:** "Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles, enhances flexibility, boosts mental health, and aids in weight management."

## 7. Completion Prompts
Completion prompts ask the model to complete a given piece of text. This is useful for text generation, autocompletion, and expanding ideas.

**Example:**
- **Prompt:** "The quick brown fox"
- **Expected Output:** "jumps over the lazy dog."

## Conclusion
Understanding the different types of prompts allows you to leverage the full potential of language models. By choosing the appropriate prompt type, you can achieve more accurate, relevant, and creative outcomes.
