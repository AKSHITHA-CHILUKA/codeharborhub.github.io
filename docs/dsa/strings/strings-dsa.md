A string is a sequence of characters. It is a data structure that represents a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. In data structures and algorithms, strings are used in a wide range of applications such as text processing, pattern matching, and data serialization.

## Why are Strings important?

Strings are important because they are used to store and manipulate text. They are used in many applications such as text processing, pattern matching, and data serialization.

## How to declare a String?

A string can be declared in various programming languages using the following syntax:

## Introduction

Strings are sequences of characters and are a fundamental data type in computer science. They are used extensively in algorithms and data structures.

## Basic String Operations

- **Length**: Determine the length of a string.
- **Concatenation**: Combine two or more strings.
- **Substring**: Extract a portion of a string.
- **Comparison**: Compare two strings lexicographically.
- **Search**: Find the occurrence of a substring.

## Pattern Matching Algorithms

- **Naive Pattern Matching**: A straightforward approach with a time complexity of O(m\*n).
- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)**: An efficient pattern matching algorithm with a time complexity of O(m+n).
- **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**: Uses hashing for pattern matching with a time complexity of O(m+n) on average.
- **Boyer-Moore Algorithm**: A powerful algorithm with a worst-case time complexity of O(m\*n) but performs well in practice.

## String Manipulation

- **Reversal**: Reversing a string.
- **Palindromes**: Checking if a string reads the same forwards and backwards.
- **Anagrams**: Checking if two strings are permutations of each other.
- **Rotation**: Rotating a string by a given number of characters.

## String Data Structures

- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: A tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, typically used for search operations.
- **Suffix Tree**: A compressed trie of all suffixes of a given string, useful for pattern matching.
- **Suffix Array**: An array of all suffixes of a string, sorted in lexicographical order.
- **Aho-Corasick Algorithm**: A trie-based data structure for multiple pattern matching.

## Common String Problems

- **Longest Common Substring**: Finding the longest substring that appears in two or more strings.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Finding the longest sequence that can be derived from two strings without changing the order of characters.
- **Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)**: Measuring the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into another.
- **String Compression**: Reducing the size of a string using algorithms like Run-Length Encoding (RLE).

## Advanced String Algorithms

- **Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)**: A data transformation algorithm useful for data compression.
- **Manacherâ€™s Algorithm**: An efficient algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring in linear time.
- **Z-Algorithm**: Finds occurrences of a pattern in a string in linear time.
