# Basic Network Devices

## Routers
Routers are devices that connect different networks and direct data packets between them. They operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and use IP addresses to determine the best path for data to travel.

### Functions of Routers
- **Packet Forwarding**: Routers receive data packets and forward them to their destination based on IP addresses.
- **Routing**: Routers maintain routing tables and use routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP) to determine the best path for data packets.
- **Network Segmentation**: Routers can divide large networks into smaller, more manageable subnets.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Routers can perform NAT, allowing multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.
- **Firewall**: Many routers have built-in firewalls to filter traffic and enhance security.

## Switches
Switches are devices that connect devices within a local area network (LAN) and operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. They use MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.

### Functions of Switches
- **Frame Forwarding**: Switches receive frames and forward them to the appropriate device based on MAC addresses.
- **MAC Address Learning**: Switches maintain a MAC address table to keep track of the devices connected to each port.
- **Segmentation**: Switches create separate collision domains, reducing network congestion and improving performance.
- **VLANs (Virtual LANs)**: Switches can create VLANs to segment network traffic logically, enhancing security and management.

## Hubs
Hubs are basic network devices that connect multiple Ethernet devices, making them act as a single network segment. They operate at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.

### Functions of Hubs
- **Data Transmission**: Hubs receive data from one device and broadcast it to all other connected devices.
- **Signal Amplification**: Hubs can amplify signals to extend the distance that data can travel.
- **Network Expansion**: Hubs can be used to connect multiple devices in a simple network.

### Limitations of Hubs
- **No Data Filtering**: Hubs do not filter data or direct it to specific devices, leading to unnecessary network traffic.
- **Single Collision Domain**: All devices connected to a hub share the same collision domain, which can lead to data collisions and network inefficiency.

## Modems
Modems are devices that modulate and demodulate analog signals for digital data transmission over telephone lines or cable systems. They enable internet connectivity by converting digital data from a computer into analog signals for transmission and vice versa.

### Functions of Modems
- **Signal Modulation**: Modems convert digital data into analog signals for transmission over telephone or cable lines.
- **Signal Demodulation**: Modems convert incoming analog signals back into digital data for the computer to process.
- **Internet Connectivity**: Modems establish and maintain a connection to the internet service provider (ISP).
- **Error Detection and Correction**: Modems can detect and correct errors that occur during data transmission.

## Access Points
Access Points (APs) are devices that allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi. They extend the range of a wired network and provide wireless connectivity.

### Functions of Access Points
- **Wireless Connectivity**: APs provide Wi-Fi access to wireless devices, enabling them to connect to a wired network.
- **Network Extension**: APs extend the coverage area of a network, allowing devices to connect from a greater distance.
- **Roaming Support**: APs enable seamless roaming, allowing devices to move between different APs without losing connectivity.
- **Security**: APs can implement wireless security protocols (e.g., WPA2, WPA3) to protect the network from unauthorized access.

## Summary
Understanding the functions of basic network devices such as routers, switches, hubs, modems, and access points is essential for designing and managing effective networks. Each device plays a specific role in ensuring efficient data transmission, network connectivity, and security.
