# Wireless Networking

## Introduction
Wireless networking allows devices to connect and communicate without physical cables, using radio frequency signals. Two common wireless technologies are Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, each serving different purposes and use cases. This document covers the basics of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and provides detailed information on Wi-Fi security.

## Basics of Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to a local area network (LAN) and access the internet without physical cables. It operates within the IEEE 802.11 standards.

### How Wi-Fi Works
- **Access Points (APs)**: Devices, such as routers, that broadcast Wi-Fi signals and connect wireless devices to a wired network.
- **Wi-Fi Adapters**: Hardware in devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones) that receive and send Wi-Fi signals.
- **Frequency Bands**: Wi-Fi typically operates on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands.
- **Channels**: Frequency bands are divided into channels to minimize interference.

### Wi-Fi Standards
- **802.11a**: Operates at 5 GHz, supports up to 54 Mbps.
- **802.11b**: Operates at 2.4 GHz, supports up to 11 Mbps.
- **802.11g**: Operates at 2.4 GHz, supports up to 54 Mbps.
- **802.11n**: Operates at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, supports up to 600 Mbps.
- **802.11ac**: Operates at 5 GHz, supports up to several Gbps.
- **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)**: Operates at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, supports higher data rates and improved performance in congested environments.

## Basics of Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a wireless technology for short-range communication between devices. It operates at 2.4 GHz and is widely used for connecting peripherals, such as keyboards, mice, headphones, and smart devices.

### How Bluetooth Works
- **Pairing**: The process of establishing a connection between two Bluetooth devices.
- **Profiles**: Define specific Bluetooth functions and applications (e.g., A2DP for audio streaming, HID for input devices).
- **Range**: Typically up to 10 meters for most devices, though some classes can reach up to 100 meters.

### Bluetooth Versions
- **Bluetooth 1.0-1.2**: Basic features with data rates up to 1 Mbps.
- **Bluetooth 2.0-2.1**: Enhanced data rates up to 3 Mbps.
- **Bluetooth 3.0**: High-Speed data transfer using Wi-Fi.
- **Bluetooth 4.0-4.2**: Low Energy (LE) for power-efficient communication.
- **Bluetooth 5.0**: Improved range, speed, and broadcast capacity.

## Wi-Fi Security
Securing a Wi-Fi network is crucial to protect data and prevent unauthorized access. Various security protocols and practices help achieve this.

### Wi-Fi Security Protocols
- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**: An older security protocol that provides weak protection due to vulnerabilities.
- **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**: Improved security over WEP with dynamic key encryption.
- **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II)**: Uses AES encryption for stronger security and is widely used today.
- **WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access III)**: The latest security protocol offering improved encryption and protection against brute-force attacks.

### Common Wi-Fi Security Measures
1. **Change Default SSID and Password**
   - **SSID (Service Set Identifier)**: The name of your Wi-Fi network. Change the default SSID to a unique name.
   - **Password**: Use a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi network.

2. **Enable Network Encryption**
   - Use WPA3 if supported; otherwise, use WPA2.

3. **Disable SSID Broadcasting**
   - Hides your Wi-Fi network from casual discovery. Devices must know the SSID to connect.

4. **Enable MAC Address Filtering**
   - Restrict network access to devices with specific MAC addresses.

5. **Use a Guest Network**
   - Set up a separate network for guests to keep your primary network secure.

6. **Regularly Update Router Firmware**
   - Keep your router's firmware up to date to protect against security vulnerabilities.

7. **Implement Network Firewalls**
   - Use built-in router firewalls and consider additional software firewalls on connected devices.

8. **Disable Remote Management**
   - Turn off remote management features unless specifically needed.

### Advanced Wi-Fi Security Practices
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: Use a VPN to encrypt internet traffic and protect data privacy.
- **Network Segmentation**: Create separate networks for different device types (e.g., IoT devices on a separate network).
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

## Summary
Wireless networking, through technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, enables convenient and flexible connectivity. Understanding the basics of these technologies and implementing robust Wi-Fi security measures is essential for protecting data and ensuring reliable communication in both personal and professional environments.
