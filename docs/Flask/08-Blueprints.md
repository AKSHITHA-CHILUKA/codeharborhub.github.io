Flask Blueprints allow you to organize your application into smaller, reusable components. This is especially useful for larger applications.

### Setting Up Blueprints

1. **Create a Blueprint:**

```python
# myapp/blueprints/main.py
from flask import Blueprint, render_template

main = Blueprint('main', __name__)

@main.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')
```

2. **Register the Blueprint:**

```python
from flask import Flask
from blueprints.main import main

app = Flask(__name__)
app.register_blueprint(main)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Project Structure

myapp/
├── app.py
├── blueprints/
│   └── main.py
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
└── static/

### Conclusion

Using Flask Blueprints helps in organizing your application into modular components, making the application structure more manageable and reusable.
