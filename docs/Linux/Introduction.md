Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. It was initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It’s totally free and you can change it to make it work just how you want. It’s like a giant toolbox that runs on everything, from phones to computers. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. Learning Linux is important because it’s everywhere even in the cloud where lots of stuff is stored. And even though it might seem scary at first, getting to know Linux can help you do cool stuff and open up new opportunities in the tech world.

These applications share the same basic components as,

- Kernel
- User Space
- Resources

People with many different job roles used Linux. Writers, Video editors, Analysts, and all kinds of professionals use this for many purposes. Software developers use Linux for their coding and development works. Also, many services on the internet are hosted on Linux servers.

## What are the fundamentals?

**The Linux Kernel**

All operating systems have kernels, but mostly when talking about the OS, we don’t talk about kernels as much as Linux kernels. It is the core of Linux distributors and open-source programs. It is originally released by Linux Torvalds (1991). A kernel is a software that gives the ability to communicate with computer software. This can run on its own and it’s required to run software on a computer. The kernel is part of a working operating system.
