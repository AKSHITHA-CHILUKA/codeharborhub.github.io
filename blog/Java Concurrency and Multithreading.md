# Java Concurrency and Multithreading

Java provides robust support for concurrency and multithreading, allowing developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This can lead to more efficient use of resources and improved performance for tasks that can be parallelized.

## Key Concepts

### Threads

A thread is a lightweight process that shares resources with other threads in the same process. Java supports multithreading through the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface.

- **Thread Class**: Extend the `Thread` class and override its `run()` method to define the code executed by the thread.
- **Runnable Interface**: Implement the `Runnable` interface and define the `run()` method. Use this implementation to create a `Thread` instance.

### Synchronization

Synchronization is crucial to ensure that multiple threads do not interfere with each other while accessing shared resources.

- **Synchronized Methods**: Use the `synchronized` keyword to restrict access to a method or block of code to one thread at a time.
- **Locks**: The `java.util.concurrent.locks` package provides more advanced synchronization mechanisms than synchronized methods.

### Concurrency Utilities

Java provides a set of utilities to simplify concurrent programming:

- **Executor Framework**: Manages a pool of threads and provides a way to execute tasks asynchronously. The `ExecutorService` interface and its implementations, such as `ThreadPoolExecutor`, facilitate task management.
- **Concurrent Collections**: Collections like `ConcurrentHashMap` and `CopyOnWriteArrayList` are designed for concurrent access.
- **Future and Callable**: The `Future` interface represents the result of an asynchronous computation, and `Callable` is similar to `Runnable` but can return a result.

## Example Usage

### Creating a Thread with `Runnable`

```java
public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in a separate thread.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

## Synchronization Example
```java
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task);
        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

## Best Practices
Minimize Synchronization: Use synchronization sparingly to avoid performance bottlenecks.
Use Concurrent Collections: Prefer concurrent collections for thread-safe data structures.
Avoid Blocking Calls: Be cautious of blocking calls that can lead to thread contention and performance issues.
Use Thread Pools: Utilize thread pools to manage a group of worker threads efficiently.
